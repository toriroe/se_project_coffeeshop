# 'Practicum Coffee Shop' Project

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at Practicum (now called Tripleten). It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform
- Embedded video content from Youtube

## Plan on improving the project

- List of more recipe links on the "Recipes" section, like an "Our Favorites" for recipes
- Having a message of some kind pop up after submitting the form, to confirm to the user that the form was submitted
